/*
  Players who sign up with Google don't give a birth date; the app asks for it after their first login.

  - Player.birth_date becomes optional.
  - Google sign-ups so far got the day they signed up as birth date. Those placeholders are cleared, so the app asks
    these players too. A Google player has no password; the placeholder is within a day of created_at (the two were
    written in different time zones).
