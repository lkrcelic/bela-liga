// it, so the unlocked table is as it was before:
//   - Nedolazak (NO_SHOW): the 1001:700 matches the answer wrote are deleted (a match an admin has since entered hands
//     into is real play and stays), the team that didn't come is back in the tournament and the app's own ban from
//     Kolo 1 is lifted. The table is new again: Započni igru starts the game.
//   - Preskočen (SKIPPED): nothing was played, so both teams come back and both bans are lifted.
//   - Vrijeme isteklo / Gotovo: the last match played is the match being played again, with its hands and the new
//     deadline, so the table carries on where it stopped. The win it was counted goes back off the table's score.
// The Kolos already made from the result stay as they are; the admin lays them out again if they want to.
