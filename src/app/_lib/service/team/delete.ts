 * stays. A team in a tournament (in it or on its waiting list) is taken out of the tournament first, where the next
 * team waiting comes in. Its players, league entries, photo and substitute ads go with it; a Novo kolo draft forgets it.
 * A missing team (or the bye) is a 404 (NotFoundError), a team that can't be deleted a 400 with the reason.
